For comparing against the data included in the paper, data and plotting code are located in [vision/plot/](./vision/plot/).

For replicating results and using the trained networks released with the paper, vision networks are located in the [vision subdirectory](./vision/), and the GNMT network is located in the [gnmt subdirectory](./gnmt/).

Some example networks (original initializations, trained, and pruned and re-trained) can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uwufcu0ogvmt13x/saved_models.zip).
